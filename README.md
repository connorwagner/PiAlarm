# PiAlarm
## An alarm system on a Pi
This will run a morning alarm system on a Raspberry Pi.

The system includes an LED strip which will simulate a sunrise for an hour before the alarm is set to go off.

Future versions will include the ability to connect to a bluetooth speaker and play an alarm tone.
